# School_District_Analysis
## Overview of the school district analysis
The school board has notified Maria and her supervisor that the data shows evidence of academic dishonesty, particularly, the reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders. In order to uphold state-testing standards, Maria has asked me to replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data as it is. I have conducted the school district analysis once again and this report will provide a description of how these changes affected the overall analysis.
